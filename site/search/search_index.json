Tip A read in a fastq file consists of four lines (more on that at file types ). Use Google to figure out how to count the number of reads in a fastq file. Answer e.g. from this thread on Biostars: ## forward read echo $( cat SRR519926_1.fastq | wc -l ) /4 | bc ## reverse read echo $( cat SRR519926_2.fastq | wc -l ) /4 | bc 2. Run fastqc 20 minutes Exercise: Run fastqc on the fastq files. Tip fastqc accepts multiple files as input, so you can use a wildcard to run fastqc on all the files in one line of code. Use it like this: *.fastq . Answer fastqc *.fastq Exercise: Download the html files to your local computer, and view the results. How is the quality? Where are the problems? Answer There seems to be: Low quality towards the 3\u2019 end (per base sequence quality) Full sequence reads with low quality (per sequence quality scores) Adapters in the sequences (adapter content) We can probably fix most of these issues by trimming. 3. Trim the reads 20 minutes We will use trimmomatic for trimming low quality and spurious bases from our reads. For paired-end data it generates four different trimmed fastq files. If one of the paired-end reads doesn\u2019t meet the quality thresholds, it will be discarded, but the other read might be kept. Therefore, trimmomatic outputs contains files with unpaired reads as well. Usually those files are very small compared to the paired reads, and are often ignored for downstream analyses. Trimmomatic syntax is rather complicated and different from most tools. Refer to the manual if you want to go deeper into this. Exercise: The script below will trim the sequence reads in a sensible manner. Execute the script to trim the data: ##!/usr/bin/env bash TRIMMOMATIC_DIR = /usr/share/Trimmomatic-0.36 TRIMMED_DIR = ~/ecoli/trimmed_data READS_DIR = ~/ecoli/reads mkdir $TRIMMED_DIR java -jar trimmomatic \\ PE \\ -threads 1 \\ -phred33 \\ $READS_DIR /SRR519926_1.fastq \\ $READS_DIR /SRR519926_2.fastq \\ $TRIMMED_DIR /paired_trimmed_SRR519926_1.fastq \\ $TRIMMED_DIR /unpaired_trimmed_SRR519926_1.fastq \\ $TRIMMED_DIR /paired_trimmed_SRR519926_2.fastq \\ $TRIMMED_DIR /unpaired_trimmed_SRR519926_2.fastq \\ ILLUMINACLIP: $TRIMMOMATIC_DIR /adapters/TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10 \\ SLIDINGWINDOW:4:5 \\ LEADING:5 \\ TRAILING:5 \\ MINLEN:25 The use of \\ In the script above you see that we\u2019re using \\ at the end of many lines.

It is in general good practice to put every option of a long command on a newline in your script and use \\ to ignore the newlines when executing.

Although the computational resources should be more than enough, it\u2019s a basic Ubuntu server, and there are no hard limits on memory or CPU usage. Take therefore into account that great power comes with great responsibility. Overloading it can result in a reboot, cancelling all running calculations. Visualisation of results Many results come in an image (e.g. .png , .jpg ) or html format. These can not be viewed directly from the server. Therefore, transfer them to your local PC first (with e.g. FileZilla or scp ), or mount the server with sshfs (more info here ). Exercises 1. First login 30 minutes Login to AWS EC2 remote server You will receive an e-mail shortly before the workshop with a key, username and IP address to login on a cloud server. Login like this: ssh -i path/to/key/key_ [ USERNAME ] .pem [ USERNAME ] @ [ AWS_IP ] Setup your favourite editor to work remotely To directly initiate and modify scripts on the remote server you can use plugins: Notepadd++: NppFTP Atom: remote-edit-ni Setup the connection to the server with the following details: protocol: sftp username: your username hostname: server IP port: 22 authentication/logon type: path to private key file 2. A UNIX command line interface (CLI) refresher 30 minutes Most bioinformatics software are UNIX based and are executed through the CLI. When working with NGS data, it is therefore convenient to improve your knowledge on UNIX. For this course, we need basic understanding of UNIX CLI, so here are some exercises to refresh your memory. Make a new directory Make a directory called reads in your home directory, and make it your current directory. Answer cd mkdir reads cd reads File permissions Generate an empty file in your newly made directory like this: cd ~/reads touch new_file.txt Can you use this file as an executable script? Answer Use ls to get the file permissions: ls -l This will give you something like: -rw-r--r-- 1 geertvangeest staff 0 Sep 21 13:38 new_file.txt In any of the user, group or other permissions, there is no x for execute. This means it is not executable Redirection: > and | In /home you\u2019ll find a directory for all users with an account. Write all usernames to a file called usernames.txt . Answer ls /home > ~/usernames.txt The command wc -l counts the number of lines, and can read from stdin. Make a one-liner with a pipe | symbol to find out how many users have an account on this server. Answer ls /home | wc -l Variables Store usernames.txt as variable (like this: VAR=variable ), and use wc -l on that variable to count the number of lines in the file. Answer FILE = usernames.txt wc -l $FILE shell scripts Make a shell script that automatically counts the current number of account-holders. Answer Make a script called e.g. current_accounts.sh : #!/usr/bin/env bash cd /home ls | wc -l 3. Detaching a job 20 minutes On this server, there is no job scheduler, so everything is run directly from the command line. That means that if a process is running, the command line will be busy, and the job will be killed upon logout. To circumvent this, there are several methods to \u2018detach\u2019 the screen or prevent a \u2018hangup signal\u2019 of a job runnig in the background that will terminate your running job. The software screen or tmux can be used to detach your screen, and all messages to stderr or stdout (if not redirected) will be printed to the (detached) console. Use those if you\u2019re comfortable with them. Another, more basic, program to prevent the \u2018hangup signal\u2019 is nohup . Use it like so: nohup [ YOUR COMMAND ] & Note Don\u2019t forget the & after the command. This symbol let\u2019s the process run in the background. So, for running e.g. a shell script this would be: nohup script.sh & Anything written to stdout or stderr will be written to the file nohup.out in your current working directory. Don\u2019t change your script while running nohup runs through your script line-by-line and reads it from disk. If you change your script while running it, it will run the new lines. Generate a script that waits for 120 seconds (use sleep ) and prints I'm done! to stdout if it\u2019s done. Answer Script called wait.sh : #!/usr/bin/env bash sleep 120 echo \"I'm done!\" Run this script in the background without a hangup signal (so, by using nohup ), logout, and login again, and see if it\u2019s still running with ps x . Answer nohup wait.sh & Remember the PID, logout and login (within 120 seconds.. ) ps x","title":"Server login"},{"location":"day1/server_login/#material","text":"","title":"Material"},{"location":"day1/server_login/#working-on-the-cloud-server","text":"Great power comes with great responsibility The cloud server is a temporary instance for this workshop only.

That means that if a process is running, the command line will be busy, and the job will be killed upon logout. To circumvent this, there are several methods to \u2018detach\u2019 the screen or prevent a \u2018hangup signal\u2019 of a job runnig in the background that will terminate your running job. The software screen or tmux can be used to detach your screen, and all messages to stderr or stdout (if not redirected) will be printed to the (detached) console. Use those if you\u2019re comfortable with them. Another, more basic, program to prevent the \u2018hangup signal\u2019 is nohup . Use it like so: nohup [ YOUR COMMAND ] & Note Don\u2019t forget the & after the command. This symbol let\u2019s the process run in the background. So, for running e.g. a shell script this would be: nohup script.sh & Anything written to stdout or stderr will be written to the file nohup.out in your current working directory. Don\u2019t change your script while running nohup runs through your script line-by-line and reads it from disk. If you change your script while running it, it will run the new lines. Generate a script that waits for 120 seconds (use sleep ) and prints I'm done! to stdout if it\u2019s done. Answer Script called wait.sh : #!/usr/bin/env bash sleep 120 echo \"I'm done!\" Run this script in the background without a hangup signal (so, by using nohup ), logout, and login again, and see if it\u2019s still running with ps x .

HCC1143 data set"},{"location":"day2/samtools/","text":"Material samtools documentation Exercises 1. Alignment statistics 10 minutes Exercise: Check out the statistics of the E. coli alignment by using samtools flagstat . Find the documentation here . Anything that draws your attention? Answer Code: cd ~/ecoli/mapping_output/ samtools flagstat SRR519926.sam resulting in: 529562 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads) 0 + 0 secondary 0 + 0 supplementary 0 + 0 duplicates 526159 + 0 mapped (99.36% : N/A) 529562 + 0 paired in sequencing 264781 + 0 read1 264781 + 0 read2 203576 + 0 properly paired (38.44% : N/A) 523484 + 0 with itself and mate mapped 2675 + 0 singletons (0.51% : N/A) 0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr 0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5) Of the reads, 38.44% is properly paired. The rest isn\u2019t. Proper pairing is quite hard to interpret. It usually means that the 0x2 flag (each segment properly aligned according to the aligner) is false. In this case it means that the insert size is high for a lot of sequences. That is because the insert size distribution is very wide. You can find info on insert size distribution like this: samtools stats SRR519926.sam | grep ^SN | cut -f 2,3 Now look at insert size average and insert size standard deviation . You can see the standard deviation is higher than the average, suggesting a wide distribution. 2. Compression, sorting and indexing 20 minutes The command samtools view is very versatile. It takes an alignment file and writes a filtered or processed alignment to the output. You can for example use it to compress your SAM file into a BAM file. Let\u2019s start with that. Exercise : compress our SAM file into a BAM file and include the header in the output. For this, use the -b and -h options. Find the required documentation here . How much was the disk space reduced by compressing the file? Tip: Samtools writes to stdout By default, samtools writes it\u2019s output to stdout. This means that you need to redirect your output to a file with > or use the the output option -o . Answer samtools view -bh SRR519926.sam > SRR519926.bam By using ls -lh , you can find out that SRR519926.sam has a size of 223 Mb, while SRR519926.bam is only 66 Mb. To look up specific alignments, it is convenient to have your alignment file indexed. An indexing can be compared to a kind of \u2018phonebook\u2019 of your sequence alignment file. Indexing can be done with samtools as well, but it first needs to be sorted on coordinate (i.e. the alignment location). You can do it like this: samtools sort SRR519926.bam > SRR519926.sorted.bam samtools index SRR519926.sorted.bam 3. Filtering 30 minutes With samtools view you can easily filter your alignment file based on flags. One thing that might be sensible to do at some point is to filter out unmapped reads. Exercise: Check out the flag that you would need to filter for mapped reads. It\u2019s at page 7 of the SAM documentation . Answer You will need the 0x4 flag. Filtering against unmapped reads (leaving only mapped reads) with samtools view would look like this: samtools view -bh -F 0x4 SRR519926.sorted.bam > SRR519926.sorted.mapped.bam Exercise: Write a command that outputs only the unmapped reads (so the opposite of the example). How many reads are in there? Is that the same as what we expect based on the output of samtools flagstat ? Tip Check out the -f and -c options of samtools view Answer Filter like this: samtools view -bh -f 0x4 SRR519926.sorted.bam > SRR519926.sorted.unmapped.bam Counting like this: samtools view -c SRR519926.sorted.unmapped.bam This corresponds to the output of samtools flagstat (529562 - 526159 = 3403) samtools view also enables you to filter alignments in a specific region. This can be convenient if you don\u2019t want to work with huge alignment files and if you\u2019re only interested in alignments in a particular region. Region filtering only works for sorted and indexed alignment files. Exercise: Filter our sorted and indexed BAM file for the region between 2000 and 2500 kb, and output it as a BAM file with a header. Tip: Specifying a region Our E. coli genome has only one chromosome, because only one line starts with > in the fasta file cd ~/ecoli/ref_genome grep \">\" ecoli-strK12-MG1655.fasta gives: >U00096.3 Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655, complete genome The part after the first space in the title is cut off for the alignment reference. So the code for specifying a region would be: U00096.3:START-END Answer samtools view -bh SRR519926.sorted.bam U00096.3:2000000-2500000 > SRR519926.sorted.region.bam 4. Redirection 20 minutes Samtools is easy to use in a pipe. In this case you can replace the input file with a - . For example, you can sort and compress the output of your alignment software in a pipe like this: my_alignment_command \\ | samtools sort - \\ | samtools view -bh - \\ > alignment.bam The use of - In the modern versions of samtools, the use of - is not needed for most cases, so without an input file it reads from stdin. However, if you\u2019re not sure, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Exercise: Write a script that maps the reads with bowtie2 (see chapter 2 of read alignment ), sorts them, takes only the mapped reads, and outputs them as a BAM file with a header.

Find the documentation here . Anything that draws your attention? Answer Code: cd ~/ecoli/mapping_output/ samtools flagstat SRR519926.sam resulting in: 529562 + 0 in total (QC-passed reads + QC-failed reads) 0 + 0 secondary 0 + 0 supplementary 0 + 0 duplicates 526159 + 0 mapped (99.36% : N/A) 529562 + 0 paired in sequencing 264781 + 0 read1 264781 + 0 read2 203576 + 0 properly paired (38.44% : N/A) 523484 + 0 with itself and mate mapped 2675 + 0 singletons (0.51% : N/A) 0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr 0 + 0 with mate mapped to a different chr (mapQ>=5) Of the reads, 38.44% is properly paired. The rest isn\u2019t. Proper pairing is quite hard to interpret. It usually means that the 0x2 flag (each segment properly aligned according to the aligner) is false. In this case it means that the insert size is high for a lot of sequences. That is because the insert size distribution is very wide. You can find info on insert size distribution like this: samtools stats SRR519926.sam | grep ^SN | cut -f 2,3 Now look at insert size average and insert size standard deviation . You can see the standard deviation is higher than the average, suggesting a wide distribution.","title":"1. Alignment statistics"},{"location":"day2/samtools/#2-compression-sorting-and-indexing","text":"20 minutes The command samtools view is very versatile. It takes an alignment file and writes a filtered or processed alignment to the output. You can for example use it to compress your SAM file into a BAM file. Let\u2019s start with that. Exercise : compress our SAM file into a BAM file and include the header in the output. For this, use the -b and -h options. Find the required documentation here . How much was the disk space reduced by compressing the file? Tip: Samtools writes to stdout By default, samtools writes it\u2019s output to stdout. This means that you need to redirect your output to a file with > or use the the output option -o . Answer samtools view -bh SRR519926.sam > SRR519926.bam By using ls -lh , you can find out that SRR519926.sam has a size of 223 Mb, while SRR519926.bam is only 66 Mb. To look up specific alignments, it is convenient to have your alignment file indexed. An indexing can be compared to a kind of \u2018phonebook\u2019 of your sequence alignment file. Indexing can be done with samtools as well, but it first needs to be sorted on coordinate (i.e. the alignment location). You can do it like this: samtools sort SRR519926.bam > SRR519926.sorted.bam samtools index SRR519926.sorted.bam","title":"2. Compression, sorting and indexing"},{"location":"day2/samtools/#3-filtering","text":"30 minutes With samtools view you can easily filter your alignment file based on flags. One thing that might be sensible to do at some point is to filter out unmapped reads. Exercise: Check out the flag that you would need to filter for mapped reads.
